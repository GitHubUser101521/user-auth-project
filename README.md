# How to Set Up 

**Step 1: Obtain the URL**

You can get the URL by clicking the green code button, and select the HTTP (as this guide is not using SSH nor GitHub CLI)

**Step 2: Open Terminal**

Open your terminal and go to the directory where you want to clone the project. 

Run this command in the terminal, preferably in your code editor: (Make sure you have git installed)
- git clone https://github.com/GitHubUser101521/user-auth-project
- npm install
- Install and configure tailwind v4.0 (please refer to [tailwindcss.com](https://tailwindcss.com) for official documentation)
- npx json-server db.json (the json file is provided in the root directory, check for data structure example)
- npm run dev (or the script configured for running development in package.json)

**Step 3: Interact with the Application**

Now you can stop setting up and start using the cloned project! You can start by testing the functionality, explore the user interface, and start working on the project itself.
